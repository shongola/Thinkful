    "\n",
    "Please submit links to all your work below. This is not a graded checkpoint, but you should discuss your solutions with your mentor. Also, when you're done, compare your work to [these example solutions](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/machine-learning-regression-problems/blob/master/notebooks/4.solution_understanding_the_relationship.ipynb).\n",

    "$$ expenditure = 873 + 0.0012annual\\_income + 0.00002annual\\_income^2 - 223.57have\\_kids $$\n",

    "*expenditure* is the annual spending on recreation in US dollars, *annual_income* is the annual income in US dollars, and *have_kids* is a dummy variable indicating the families with children. Interpret the estimated coefficients. What additional statistics should be given in order to make sure that your interpretations make sense statistically. Write up your answer."

    "The constant in this model is 873 with an annual income coefficient of 0.0012 and annual income 2 coefficient of 0.00002 and a have kids coefficient of -223.57. This model is fitted at 873 where it crosses the Y-axis. Additionally it appears that families with kids spend 223.57 less than those without on recreation not considering annual income. We would want to run t-tests and p-values on each coefficient to see their statistical significance to interpret value derived from them in the model.\n",

Interpret the estimated coefficients. What are the relations between the target and the explanatory variables? \n",
